As a web/mobile/desktop programming expert with 10+ years of experience and powerful 
mathematics/data structures/algorithms design background, I've always designed and built awesome 
software products based on the strong robust logic, maintainable quality coding and abstraction.
I regard keeping time and quality as the most important one while in development.
